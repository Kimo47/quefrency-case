Quefrency Keyboard Case
=======================

Here's case design file for the [Quefrency](https://keeb.io/products/quefrency-60-split-staggered-keyboard). You can turn on/off various layers to generate the different plates needed.

The main files that the everything else has been derived from are the .ai (Adobe Illustrator) files. The .ai files have multiple layers to toggle on/off to generate the correct set of plates/mid-layers/etc.

The difference between Rev 1 and Rev 2 plates are the following:

- Rev 2 does not have Alps support, while Rev 1 does
- Rev 2 adds ISO support and a few more bottom row layout options
- Rev 2 has a different arrangement of screw/standoff holes to allow for an acrylic mid layer to be used

To be uploaded soon:

- SVGs for left and right plates
