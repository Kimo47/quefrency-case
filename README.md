Quefrency Keyboard Case
=======================

Here's case design file for the [Quefrency](https://keeb.io/products/quefrency-60-split-staggered-keyboard). You can turn on/off various layers to generate the different plates needed.

The main files that the everything else has been derived from are the .ai (Adobe Illustrator) files. The .ai files have multiple layers to toggle on/off to generate the correct set of plates/mid-layers/etc.

The difference between Rev 1 and Rev 2 plates are the following:

- Rev 2 does not have Alps support, while Rev 1 does
- Rev 2 adds ISO support and a few more bottom row layout options
- Rev 2 has a different arrangement of screw/standoff holes to allow for an acrylic mid layer to be used

To be uploaded soon:

- SVGs for left and right plates

## Rev. 2

The plate files in the [main rev2 directory](rev2/) are designed for 1.5mm thick plates. If doing acrylic plates, then either a thickness of 3mm or 5mm should be used. Files for these thicker plates can be found in the [3mm Plates](rev2/3mm Plates) and [5mm Plates](rev2/5mm Plates) directories. The difference with these thicker plates is that the stabilizer cutouts are larger to accomdate the stabilzer housing and wire.
